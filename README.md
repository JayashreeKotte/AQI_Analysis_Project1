## Overview

Air pollution stands as the fourth primary risk factor leading to premature mortality and holds the position of the primary environmental cause of death on a global scale, contributing to over 7 million (which amounts to 1 out of 8) deaths, as per estimations by the World Health Organization. Almost 99% of the global population is exposed to contaminated air, reducing life expectancy by an average of 2.2 years worldwide.

The objective of this project revolves around examining real-time air quality data across all the states in the United States to determine the states with the most favorable and unfavorable air quality conditions. We aim to conduct a deeper analysis of air quality within these identified states, aiming to uncover any discernible patterns associated with seasonal variations and extract valuable insights from these observations.


## Research Questions
When conducting an analysis of Air Quality Index (AQI), various research questions can guide the investigation towards gaining comprehensive insights into air quality. Here are several potential research questions for AQI analysis:

1. Temporal Trends:

    * How does AQI vary over different timescales (daily, monthly, seasonally, yearly)?
    * Are there long-term trends in AQI, and if so, what factors might be contributing to these trends?

2. Geographical Variations:

    * What are the spatial variations in AQI across different regions, states, or cities?
    * Are there notable differences in air quality between urban and rural areas?

3. Pollutants Analysis:

    * Which pollutants contribute most significantly to higher AQI levels in specific locations?
    * How do different pollutants correlate with each other, and how do they collectively impact AQI?

4. Impact on Health and Environment:

    * What are the health impacts associated with varying AQI levels?
    * How does AQI affect vulnerable populations (e.g., children, elderly, individuals with respiratory conditions)?
    * What are the environmental implications of high or low AQI levels?

5. Seasonal Patterns and Weather Influence:

    * How do seasonal changes influence AQI levels?
    * What role does weather (temperature, humidity, wind patterns) play in affecting AQI fluctuations?

## Approach

To answer some of these questions, we analyzed the Air Quality Index in different States in the US and factored in various contributors.
The Air Quality Index (AQI) considers several air pollutants when calculating the overall air quality. The common pollutants that contribute to AQI calculations include:

1. Particulate Matter:

    * PM2.5: Particulate Matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller
    * PM10: Particulate Matter with a diameter of 10 micrometers or smaller

2. Ozone:O3
3. Nitrogen Dioxide: NO2
4. Sulfur Dioxide: SO2
5. Carbon Monoxide: CO

These pollutants are monitored because of their significant impact on air quality and their potential adverse effects on human health and the environment. The AQI is calculated based on the concentrations of these pollutants measured in the air. AQI values are categorized into different levels, ranging from good to hazardous, to provide an indication of the air quality and associated health risks to the public.

Different regions or countries may have variations in the specific pollutants considered in their AQI calculations based on local air quality standards and environmental concerns. However, the pollutants listed above are among the most commonly monitored and factored into AQI calculations worldwide.
